# Monitoring and Alerting Strategies

## Overview
This document outlines the monitoring and alerting strategies implemented in the application to ensure reliability and performance. The goal is to proactively identify issues and respond to incidents effectively.

## Monitoring Strategy
We utilize Prometheus for monitoring our application. The following key metrics are collected:

1. **Request Latency**: Measures the time taken to process requests.
2. **Error Rates**: Tracks the number of failed requests over time.
3. **CPU and Memory Usage**: Monitors the resource utilization of the application server.
4. **Custom Application Metrics**: Any specific metrics relevant to the business logic of the application.

### Metrics Collection
Metrics are collected using the Prometheus client library integrated into the application. The `prometheus.ts` file in the `src/monitoring` directory is responsible for setting up the metrics and exposing them for Prometheus to scrape.

## Alerting Strategy
Alerts are configured based on the metrics collected. The following alerts are set up:

1. **High Request Latency**: Trigger an alert if the 95th percentile latency exceeds 500ms for a sustained period of 5 minutes.
2. **Increased Error Rate**: Trigger an alert if the error rate exceeds 5% of total requests over a 5-minute window.
3. **High Resource Utilization**: Trigger an alert if CPU usage exceeds 80% or memory usage exceeds 75% for more than 10 minutes.

### Alerting Mechanism
Alerts are sent to a Slack channel and logged in our incident management system. We use Alertmanager to handle alerts from Prometheus and route them appropriately.

## Conclusion
The monitoring and alerting strategies are crucial for maintaining the reliability of the application. By continuously monitoring key metrics and setting up alerts, we can quickly respond to incidents and ensure a smooth user experience.
