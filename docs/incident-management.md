# Incident Management Process

## Overview
The incident management process is crucial for maintaining the reliability and availability of our web application. This document outlines the steps for reporting, tracking, and resolving incidents to ensure minimal disruption to users.

## Incident Reporting
1. **Identification**: Any team member or user can identify an incident. Incidents may include application downtime, performance degradation, or security breaches.
2. **Reporting**: Incidents should be reported through the designated communication channel (e.g., Slack, email, or an incident management tool). The report should include:
   - A brief description of the incident
   - The time of occurrence
   - The impact on users
   - Any relevant logs or error messages

## Incident Tracking
1. **Logging**: All reported incidents will be logged in the incident management system. Each incident will be assigned a unique identifier for tracking purposes.
2. **Categorization**: Incidents will be categorized based on severity:
   - **Critical**: Major impact on users, requires immediate attention.
   - **High**: Significant impact, but a workaround may be available.
   - **Medium**: Moderate impact, can be scheduled for resolution.
   - **Low**: Minimal impact, can be addressed in future releases.

## Incident Resolution
1. **Assessment**: The on-call engineer will assess the incident and determine the appropriate response.
2. **Response**: The team will work collaboratively to resolve the incident. This may involve:
   - Investigating logs and metrics
   - Implementing a fix or workaround
   - Communicating with affected users
3. **Resolution Confirmation**: Once the incident is resolved, the team will confirm that the application is functioning as expected and that users are no longer affected.

## Post-Incident Review
1. **Documentation**: After resolution, a post-incident review will be conducted to document the incident, response actions, and lessons learned.
2. **Improvement**: The team will identify areas for improvement in the incident management process and update documentation as necessary.

## Communication
Throughout the incident management process, clear communication is essential. Regular updates should be provided to stakeholders and affected users until the incident is resolved.

## Incident Example

### Incident: Application Downtime Detected by Prometheus Alert
- **Time:** 2025-06-01 16:10 (UTC+5)
- **Detection:** Prometheus triggered the `TargetDown` alert (service app was not responding).
- **Reporting:** Alert was automatically sent to the team channel in Slack.
- **Assessment:** On-call engineer checked the Prometheus dashboard and confirmed the app container was stopped.
- **Response:**
  1. Engineer ran `docker compose ps` to verify container status.
  2. Found that the app container had exited due to an unhandled exception in the code.
  3. Logs were reviewed using `docker compose logs app`.
  4. The bug was fixed and the app was restarted with `docker compose up -d app`.
- **Resolution Confirmation:** Prometheus alert changed to "Resolved" state. Application was accessible and healthy.
- **Post-Incident Review:**
  - Root cause: Unhandled exception in request handler.
  - Action items: Added error handling and improved logging.
  - Documentation updated in this file.

## Conclusion
By following this incident management process, we aim to ensure a swift response to incidents, minimize user impact, and continuously improve our applicationâ€™s reliability.
