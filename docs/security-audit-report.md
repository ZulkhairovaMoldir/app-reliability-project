# Security Audit Report: app-reliability-project

## 1. Overview
This report summarizes the results of a security audit for the app-reliability-project infrastructure, including application code, Docker, CI/CD, and monitoring stack.

## 2. Identified Vulnerabilities & Risks

### 2.1. Application Layer
- **No authentication/authorization**: The app endpoints are publicly accessible.
- **No input validation**: Potential for injection attacks if user input is added in the future.
- **No HTTPS**: Traffic between users and nginx is unencrypted.

### 2.2. Docker & Infrastructure
- **Default passwords**: Grafana uses the default admin password (`admin`).
- **No resource limits**: Docker containers have no CPU/memory limits set.
- **No healthchecks**: Docker Compose lacks healthcheck definitions for services.
- **Sensitive files in image**: Secrets/configs may be copied into images if not excluded.
- **Prometheus and Grafana exposed**: Monitoring UIs are accessible without authentication.

### 2.3. CI/CD Pipeline
- **No secrets management**: No use of GitHub Secrets for sensitive data.
- **No image scanning**: Pipeline does not scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- **No dependency audit**: No npm audit or similar in pipeline.

### 2.4. Network & Monitoring
- **No firewall/network segmentation**: All services are on the same network, all ports open.
- **No alerting for security events**: Only basic availability alerts are configured.

## 3. Recommendations & Remediations

### 3.1. Application
- Implement authentication and authorization for all endpoints.
- Add input validation and sanitization.
- Use HTTPS (TLS termination at nginx).

### 3.2. Docker & Infrastructure
- Set strong, unique passwords for Grafana and other UIs; use environment variables or secrets.
- Add resource limits (cpu, mem) in docker-compose.yml for all services.
- Define healthchecks for all containers in docker-compose.yml.
- Exclude sensitive files from Docker images using .dockerignore.
- Restrict access to Prometheus and Grafana (network policies, authentication).

### 3.3. CI/CD
- Store secrets in GitHub Secrets and reference them in workflows.
- Add steps for `npm audit` and Docker image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) in the pipeline.
- Restrict who can trigger deployments (branch protection, required reviews).

### 3.4. Network & Monitoring
- Limit exposed ports to only those needed (nginx, not Prometheus/Grafana in production).
- Use firewalls or Docker network segmentation.
- Add security alerting (e.g., failed login attempts, config changes).

## 4. Next Steps
- Assign remediation tasks to responsible team members.
- Re-audit after fixes are applied.
- Document security policies and incident response procedures.
