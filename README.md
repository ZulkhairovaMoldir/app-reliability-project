# Application Reliability Project

## Overview
This project aims to implement Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to ensure the reliability of a web application. The application is built using TypeScript and Express, and it incorporates monitoring, alerting, and incident management strategies.

```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd app-reliability-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. The application includes various routes that can be explored.

## Monitoring and Alerting
The project utilizes Prometheus for monitoring. Metrics are collected and exposed for Prometheus to scrape, ensuring that the application's performance and reliability can be tracked effectively.

## Incident Management
A structured incident management process is in place to handle any issues that arise. This includes reporting, tracking, and resolving incidents in a timely manner.

## Documentation
